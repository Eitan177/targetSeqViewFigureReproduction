The purpose of this code is to reproduce the figures from our paper accompanying
the release of the targetSeqView package (Halper-Stromberg, 2013), and to provide
the underlying data which we used to develop our method. This code was
developed on linux and has not been tested on other systems.

To setup:
1) install targetSeqView as an R package (available from https://github.com/Eitan177/targetSeqView)
2) install this code as an R package
3) load this package in R and run the source code file, reproduceFigs.R,  located 
   in the extdata folder

All of our data exists in the extdata folder, including:
    full alignment bam files (1320KB00[01][0-9].bam)
    multiple alignment bam files for discordant read pairs (1320KB00[01][0-9]MulitpleAlnsort.bam)
    bam index files (*bai)
    results from GASV (*clusters), HYDRA (*final), and VariationHunter (*SV)
    repeat element files (repeatMaskerbaits.txt, genomicSuperDups.txt)
    target capture bait loci (sureselectformat.bed)
    events failing/passing validation (NotValidated*txt, Validated*txt)
    events representing canonical V(D)J (1211canonicalNotValidated.txt)
    V(D)J elements involved in validated/canonical events (regVDJ.txt,irregVDJ.txt)
    alignability wig file (wgEncodeCrgMapabilityAlign100mer.bigWig)
