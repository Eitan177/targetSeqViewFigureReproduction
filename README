The purpose of this code is to reproduce the figures from our paper accompanying
the release of the targetSeqView package (Halper-Stromberg, 2013).

To setup, first install the targetSeqView package. Second, install this
code as an R package and then run the source code file, reproduceFigs.R,  located 
in the extdata folder. All of our data exists in the extdata folder, including
bam files, and results from GASV,HYDRA,and VariationHunter.
